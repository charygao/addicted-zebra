&lt;p&gt;Portland five-piece &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31000-wampire/" target="_blank"&gt;Wampire&lt;/a&gt;'s debut, &lt;i&gt;Curiosity&lt;/i&gt;, casts the familiar gold sounds of a bygone and misspent youth (1960s psychedelia, 70s soft rock, 80s new wave) as something foreign and, at times, a little unsettling. It's nostalgic, but with the reflection seen through a funhouse mirror. Like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/" target="_blank"&gt;Ariel Pink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30523-foxygen/" target="_blank"&gt;Foxygen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="pitchfork.com/artists/28890-unknown-mortal-orchestra/" target="_blank"&gt;Unknown Mortal Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; before them, Wampire's emergence seems to have benefitted from the trail blazed by &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/" target="_blank"&gt;MGMT&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14122-congratulations/" target="_blank"&gt;Congratulations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Although the Brooklyn band’s second album may have been deemed a disappointment by major label standards, in retrospect, its glam-smeared, hyper-frazzled psych pop anticipated alt-rock’s subsequent turn towards the strange.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recorded by UMO bassist Jacob Portrait, &lt;i&gt;Curiosity&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t shy away from its retro allusions, from the bizarro-world Sears-family-portrait cover art to the dust-covered production, which approximates the fidelity of an overly over-dubbed cassette. Wampire first formed in 2007 as a beat-driven electronic project to soundtrack Portland house parties; that it’s taken the core members, Eric Phipps and Rocky Tinder, six years to issue a proper debut album hints at both the elastic, evolutionary qualities of their sound and a patient approach to organzing the album's seemingly random elements. While the surface haziness lends &lt;i&gt;Curiosity&lt;/i&gt; a sloppy, off-the-cuff appearance, it’s very much by design.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wampire’s attention to craft is immediately apparent in lead single &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14773-the-hearse/" target="_blank"&gt;“The Hearse”&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the album with a blissful blur of synth-powered dream-pop. Suddenly, they kickstart the beat and dissolve into an eerie organ drone that’s used as the foundation for the song’s heart-racing, motorik climax. But if “The Hearse” packs an impressive amount of drama and dynamic range into its four-and-a-half minutes, much of &lt;i&gt;Curiosity&lt;/i&gt; finds Wampire a bit too comfortable and self-satisfied within their washed-out aesthetic, and the premeditated haziness of the recordings-- and obvious attempts to weird them up, through squeaky synth settings and effete vocal tics-- ultimately undermines the duo’s songwriting ambitions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Giants” is the busiest of all-- comprising a rumbling surf-punk riff, waves of wah-wah-ed guitars, haunted-house organs, a bop-along Beach Boys-via-Panda Bear melody, a melancholic mid-song breakdown-- but the metronomic rhythm and compressed dimensions sap the song of its delirious potential, plotting all the action on a straight line. And though the anxious energy underpinning Phipps’ and Tinder’s vocals is palpable throughout, whenever they get too close to opening up emotionally, they resort to affectation: The sad-eyed sentiments of “Outta Money” are communicated through a comically droopy warble, while &lt;i&gt;Curiosity&lt;/i&gt;’s most resonant song, “Trains”, could practically pass for &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3bUg8wsgVE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;vintage Jackson Browne&lt;/a&gt;, if not for a self-consciously cheeky delivery that diminishes the romantic longing expressed within. Since their inauspicious, experimental beginnings, Wampire have obviously matured greatly as songwriters; now, they just need to channel that same confidence and daring into the execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still don't know his name, but &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28121-gold-panda/" target="_blank"&gt;Gold Panda&lt;/a&gt; has made it easy for us to know him. The British producer's debut, 2010's &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14732-lucky-shiner/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lucky Shiner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was an emotive tapestry of personal history, with textures that evoked imagery with a distinct personal glow. On his second album and first substantial release in three years, &lt;i&gt;Half of Where You Live&lt;/i&gt;, Gold Panda shifts the focus from who he is to where he's been.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This shift makes sense. The success he's enjoyed has sent him far from the suburban Essex enclave he once called home. &lt;i&gt;Lucky Shiner&lt;/i&gt; cuts like "India Lately" and "Same Dream China" swirled the culturally distinctive sounds of plucked strings and tangled sitar detritus into their respective mixes. 2009's &lt;i&gt;Miyamae&lt;/i&gt; EP took its name from a ward of the Japanese city of Kawasaki; its bookended cuts were named, respectively, "Back Home" and "Long Vacation". Clearly, the act of leaving is far more intriguing to him than returning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A quick scan of &lt;i&gt;Half of Where You Live&lt;/i&gt;'s tracklist uncovers more name-checked locales-- Brazil, Hong Kong, the Japanese island of Enoshima, the British town of Flinton-- but above all else, Gold Panda's current residence of Berlin looms large. Whereas &lt;i&gt;Lucky Shiner&lt;/i&gt; had a bright, nostalgic glow, &lt;i&gt;Half of Where You Live&lt;/i&gt; is distinctly darker and, at points, clubbier than its predecessor. The glimmering synths and hazy, chiming techno featured on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/15555-james-holden/" target="_blank"&gt;James Holden&lt;/a&gt;'s Border Community label are reference points here, alongside shimmering vignettes that call back to the pretty-sounding IDM that German imprint Morr Music was known for in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Half of Where You Live&lt;/i&gt; doesn't mark the first time Gold Panda's flirted with more distinctly dancey fare, but it's he's never been this successful with it. For all its winsome elegance, there were moments on &lt;i&gt;Lucky Shiner&lt;/i&gt; that, for better or worse, sounded truly handmade to the point that you could practically hear Gold Panda's fingers mashing hia Akai MPC. The MPC is still present here-- the gurgling "S950" takes its name from a specific model of the sampling equipment-- but these tracks sound smoother and more refined, a logical progression from the staticky amniotic techno that made up this year's brief stopgap EP, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17701-gold-panda-trust-ep/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trust&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gold Panda's long been someone who works very well in miniature form; his talent for pushing repetition to the brink of its greatest, most pleasurable effect is documented by the attention-grabbing success of early singles &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11415-quitters-raga/" target="_blank"&gt;"Quitter's Raga"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11877-you/" target="_blank"&gt;"You"&lt;/a&gt;. But his ability to expand his vision to fit longer forms is his secret weapon. The nearly psychedelic sprawl of "India Lately" already suggested as much, and on &lt;i&gt;Half of Where You Live&lt;/i&gt;, Gold Panda delivers his most potent side-stretcher in the form of "Brazil". The six-minute track is the closest thing this album comes to in terms of anthems, as a hollow bassline and a male voice repeating the titular city's name build the backbone. A mess of chimes come crashing in, the beat drops, and then picks up again with a tangy, winding synth line that makes for a seismic, satisfying addition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Brazil" is &lt;i&gt;Half of Where You Live&lt;/i&gt;'s big highlight, and the subtlety of its charms extend to the record as a whole. The winsome, direct melodies that marked &lt;i&gt;Lucky Shiner&lt;/i&gt;'s high points are largely absent here, which may cause some to consider the album a slight disappointment. That's understandable, but ultimately the success of &lt;i&gt;Half of Where You Live &lt;/i&gt;lies not in Gold Panda repeating old tricks, but in how he's expanded his repertoire to include new sounds, and his aesthetic proves sturdy enough to accomdate them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;i&gt;Field of Reeds&lt;/i&gt;’ title and final track, Jack Barnett idly sings, “You asked if the islands would float away… I said, &lt;i&gt;yes&lt;/i&gt;.” The answer comes back with a dead-eyed conviction that makes it feel as if Barnett has lost sight of the solid shoreline, something he'll definitely be accused of with &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5694-these-new-puritans/" target="_blank"&gt;These New Puritans&lt;/a&gt;’ third album. It sees the Southend group all but shed any assocations they once had with the wider rock world, reinventing themselves as a neo-classical ensemble. The result is an uncompromisingly self-possessed record whose intimate qualities shouldn't be mistaken for an easy listen-- in many respects, its clearest analog is &lt;a href="pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/" target="_blank"&gt;Talk Talk&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Eden. &lt;/i&gt;It opens with a Portuguese jazz vocalist, Elisa Rodrigues, singing a sparkling, barely half-remembered version of Herb Alpert’s “This Guy’s in Love With You”. As it ends, Adrian Peacock, who has the lowest known singing voice in Britain, unleashes an apparently bottomless vocal drone, sounding as if he’s humming along to a Sunn O))) song, while Barnett chants in phonetics like a tricksy goblin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite releasing three markedly different albums over the past five years, the Puritans have earned the trust of their audience, allowing them to go wherever their iconoclastic spirit takes them. Their debut album, 2008’s &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11295-beat-pyramid/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beat Pyramid&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, took the moony British post-punk phenomenon of the preceding few years and made it &lt;i&gt;nasty&lt;/i&gt;, agitated, and wholly uninterested in emotive melancholy or accessible lyrical subjects. Numerology and olde magick were central, though good luck trying to prise much else from it. “You know I’ll be thinking this music’s symbolic/ This music is weightless, and when I sing, so am I/ You’ll be slashing at the air, describing nothing,” Barnett sang with deterrent glee on “Swords of Truth”. He's been equally oblique describing &lt;i&gt;Field of Reeds&lt;/i&gt;. “I’m just putting one sound in front of the other and thinking about what comes next,” he &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/may/30/these-new-puritans-record-hawk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the&lt;i&gt; Guardian.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its follow-up, 2010’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13951-hidden/" target="_blank"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;sounded like a strikingly, elegantly choreographed war, at once global and gothic with its destructive beats, mournful laments, and taunting vocals. And now, &lt;i&gt;Field of Reeds&lt;/i&gt; is a stilled, abstract pastoral of sorts, where the music seems to grow and swarm as naturally as moss across rocks. Its closest modern peer might be &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/" target="_blank"&gt;Julia Holter&lt;/a&gt;'s equally pristine &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16352-ekstasis/" target="_blank"&gt;Ekstasis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;Hidden&lt;/i&gt; traded in damning impact, &lt;i&gt;Field of Reeds&lt;/i&gt; uses Barnett’s self-taught compositional prowess-- and the borrowed skills of composers André de Ridder, Michel van der Aa, and Hans Ek-- to explore the effects of memory, requiring investment on the listener's part, too; “Spiral” seems to repeat a clarinet motif from &lt;i&gt;Hidden&lt;/i&gt;; “Organ Eternal” rekindles the glassy pulse of “V (Island Song)” with the resonator piano, a riff that in turn strongly recalls “Tubular Bells”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Field of Reeds&lt;/i&gt; was recorded over 12 months in three different studios. The drums were added around structures determined by the strings, horns, and magnetic resonator piano-- a haunted, silvery-sounding creation-- and barely appear at all in the album’s final third (Barnett has suggested there are three movements here). Somehow, the effect is more intimidating than the parts on &lt;i&gt;Hidden&lt;/i&gt; where they smashed melons to simulate crushing a skull. The spareness and sense of space on &lt;i&gt;Field of Reeds&lt;/i&gt; is remarkable, the kind that'll make you glance over your shoulder as beguiling mercury-slicked glows slip into an overwhelming, sometimes vicious sense of anxiety; "There is something there," as Barnett sings on "Fragment Two".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These shifts are made even more unsettling by the lack of aggression in the playing; where &lt;i&gt;Hidden&lt;/i&gt;’s M.O. could be found in “Attack Music”, on &lt;i&gt;Field of Reeds&lt;/i&gt; there’s the sense that these glowing clarinets and strings are occurring naturally, almost as if emanating from a landscape. Gone too is the obtuse vocal phrasing that ran through &lt;i&gt;Beat Pyramid&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hidden&lt;/i&gt;; Barnett has talked about spending “hours going through each sentence of the lyrics getting rid of all the consonants,” a defamiliarizing effect that makes his lines as slippery and memory-foxing as the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uLpRvERjLE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;dream-speak in “Twin Peaks”&lt;/a&gt;. It's as upsetting too; &lt;i&gt;Field of Reeds&lt;/i&gt;' quiet lyrical narrative seems to follow a period of loss; first a person, and subsequently, trust in any kind of concrete meaning, underpinned by the way lines disintegrate into phonetic babble. As his fastidious techniques show, Barnett is a total perfectionist-- he proudly made George play 76 drum takes on one song-- yet his control freakiness hasn’t killed the record; the effect is naturalistic, and often deeply moving, rather than in any way inert.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While &lt;i&gt;Field of Reeds&lt;/i&gt; is a mysterious album in many ways, what it makes clear is Barnett’s faith in the purity of sound, rather than words, to communicate; remember, "This music is weightless, and when I sing, so am I." By removing any imposition of context, his words of consonants, his music of attention-grabbing impact, his ensemble of rock band-status, he’s created a truly strange and beautiful record. Whether Barnett makes it explicit or not, These New Puritans’ songs have always been concerned with their South-Easterly corner of the coast, the smoggy bowel of London where &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunsell_Forts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;rusting World War II fortifications&lt;/a&gt; stand demilitarized among the islands, just like the sounds on this album. “Secret recordings were made in the marsh,” Barnett chanted on &lt;i&gt;Hidden&lt;/i&gt;’s “We Want War”. It feels as though he finally trusts us to hear them on &lt;i&gt;Field of Reeds&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the band's followers, the announcement of a new &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31293-the-oblivians/"&gt;Oblivians&lt;/a&gt; album in 2013 was a big deal. Their last proper full-length, which came out 16 years ago, featured a punk rock band at the height of their power. The Memphis trio made music that was legitimately funny and provocative, and they made it sound &lt;i&gt;dangerous&lt;/i&gt;. Between 1995 and 1997, they packed in blown out guitars and snarling, guttural vocals, all of which could have been filtered through a rusted out tin can. Their songs were fast and loud, and when they made their last proper record in 1997 with New Orleans weirdo composer &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3489-quintron/"&gt;Mr. Quintron&lt;/a&gt;, they sounded like the MC5 being backed by an organist. They weren't around for very long, but in their relatively short time together, they cemented themselves as godfathers to today's garage punk landscape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then, all three members of the band have kept pretty busy. Jack Yarber made some solo albums under the name &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29941-jack-oblivian/"&gt;Jack Oblivian&lt;/a&gt;, most recently on 2011's solid LP &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15841-rat-city/"&gt;Rat City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Greg Cartwright became the frontman of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3645-reigning-sound/"&gt;Reigning Sound&lt;/a&gt;. Eric Friedl founded &lt;a href="http://www.goner-records.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Goner Records&lt;/a&gt;. So with some solid achievements under each of their belts, they're back with a reunion album that, in the context of other band reunions, arrives at an ideal time. They've been away for a while, sure, but not long enough to make &lt;i&gt;Desperation&lt;/i&gt; remotely analogous to the new &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/17298-iggy-and-the-stooges/" target="_blank"&gt;Iggy and the Stooges&lt;/a&gt; record. (To say nothing of the music from &lt;i&gt;Ready to Die&lt;/i&gt;, Oblivians don't have multiple decades seperating their new work and their best work.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there's something that needs to be considered when approaching &lt;i&gt;Desperation&lt;/i&gt;: This is not the same Oblivians from 1995's &lt;i&gt;Soul Food&lt;/i&gt;. This isn't a scrappy, lo-fi punk band brazenly giving songs titles like "Then I Fucked Her" or "Nigger Rich". (In fact, they've pretty much sworn off writing "the nihilistic rock anthem" following the deaths of some close friends, including Jay Reatard. Cartwright &lt;a href="http://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/lets-rock-and-roll-with-the-oblivians/Content?oid=3420828" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt;, "I don't want a record full of swear words. I don't want to offend people.") The influences sound similar, but &lt;i&gt;Desperation &lt;/i&gt;sounds slicker than ever. Their singing is stripped of its former bite, and while they still ramp up the fuzz, it's a much cleaner-sounding album made at Dan Auerbach's Nashville studio. And as a whole, it's very inconsistent. There are songs that quickly reveal themselves as unfortunately repetitive ("Pinball King", "Fire Detector") and others where the melody and tone just aren't that interesting over 2.5 minutes of music ("Oblivion"). Probably the biggest indication that they're no longer the same band: The songs written by Cartwright (like "EM" and "Desperation") sound more like a fuzzed out Reigning Sound, whose melodies tap more into 1960s pop than archival Oblivians did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's not to insult Reigning Sound, a band with great records-- those just aren't the sorts of songs you're conditioned to hear on an Oblivians record. So predictably, the strongest moments on &lt;i&gt;Desperation&lt;/i&gt; come when the trio tap into the strengths from their old albums. "Loving Cup" is a ripping cover of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band track (in the tradition of their blistering 1995 cover of Lightnin' Hopkins' "Vietnam War Blues"). "Call the Police" once again features Quintron's organ in a solid interpretation of Stephanie McDee's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b82Qt3STlIU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;R&amp;amp;B/zydeco track&lt;/a&gt;. Two of Yarber's writing contributions are huge highlights: the punk burner "Run For Cover" and the doe-eyed ballad "Little War Child". But with this album going in so many directions, the inevitable duds, which flank the highlights, make it hard to get excited about it as a whole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a recent interview, Friedl &lt;a href="http://www.getbent.fm/interview-eric-oblivian-on-gonerfest-memphis-and-the/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;joked&lt;/a&gt;, "People will hate [&lt;i&gt;Desperation&lt;/i&gt;] when it comes out and in 30 years, when it doesn’t matter anymore, kids will think it’s really great." Maybe this was Friedl's admission that the Oblivians grew up and inevitably made an album that didn't sound anything like their early work. Maybe he's saying that this album needs to be given its own context and removed from the pressures that come along with being the first Oblivians album in nearly two decades. And that's fair-- history and high expectations can irrevocably mar the way you take in a band's post-reunion album. But down the line, the kids will probably still have access to &lt;i&gt;Soul Food&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Popular Favorites&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Play 9 Songs With Mr. Quintron.&lt;/i&gt; Ultimately, those albums are more immediately gratifying and fun than this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what Hannes Norrvide does as &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30758-lust-for-youth/" target="_blank"&gt;Lust for Youth&lt;/a&gt;: He sets up two simple melody lines on his Casio keyboard. He lets them ram ceaselessly into each other like abandoned go-karts. And then, over a muted thump of a drum machine, he hollers into the void. That's his entire M.O., and on paper it sounds about as appetizing as sucking stale air from an open freezer. But Norrvide makes surprisingly tactile, even sensual music this way, and on &lt;i&gt;Perfect View&lt;/i&gt;, his second full length in only six months, he rides his own modestly cresting wave. He is still making the exact same sound, and it remains narrowly captivating in the exact same way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The production on &lt;i&gt;Perfect View &lt;/i&gt;is marginally cleaner and warmer than last fall's &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17366-growing-seeds/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Growing Seeds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it a lusher and prettier listen. But these are relative terms-- “unnerving” and “lonely” probably suit Lust for Youth better. &lt;i&gt;Growing Seeds’ &lt;/i&gt;particular unnerving loneliness came not just from its sonic murk but from the traces of unease the murk failed to cover, and &lt;i&gt;Perfect View&lt;/i&gt;, with its richer, mellower synths and deeper sound, brings Norrvide closer into focus. But his thick Swedish accent, muffled by reverb, still keeps us at an arms-length from his message: When he repeatedly chants the title of “I Found Love”, it sounds more like, “I’ve fallen off.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norrvide has insisted in interviews that his songs are about love, relationships, and morality. They probably are, but you'll find very little in this music to tell you so. What you'll hear, above all, is a firm belief in the comfort of synthesizers-- the wide, lonely bands of sound they make, the cottony feeling they leave in your mind. The song titles function like blank, terse placards-- "Another Day", "End", "Image"-- and the hum of the music acts similarly, as a mild anaesthetic, a small tonic for the times you'd rather erase your feelings for a few minutes than think about them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sifting through &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Perfect View &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;to find highlightable moments proves surprisingly difficult: there's the nearly-funky bongo break on “Another Day”, the little bits of sampled speech that pop up on "Barcelona" and elsewhere; “Kirsten” and closer “I Found Love in a Different Place” turn the drum hits way up, and hint at what Lust for Youth might eventually sound like if Norrvide cleared his throat and demanded our undivided attention. But these details melt the minute you stop focusing on them, and I think Norrvide means them to. Listening normally, the songs blur together like fan blades, and it's hard to tell how long you've been listening to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Perfect View&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. His is the ambient music of someone else's party, happening far away from where you are, and the distance is part of the allure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Apologies, meet apologies," &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28248-surfer-blood/" target="_blank"&gt;Surfer Blood&lt;/a&gt;'s John Paul Pitts sings on "Demon Dance", the lead-off track from his band's second LP, &lt;i&gt;Pythons&lt;/i&gt;. Pitts spends most of &lt;i&gt;Pythons&lt;/i&gt; pleading, bargaining, rationalizing, trying to make some sense of an increasingly dire situation in any way he can. There's a longstanding tendency in pop music to read too much autobiography into lyrics. In &lt;i&gt;Pythons&lt;/i&gt;' case, this kind of conflation's all but unavoidable; just before it was recorded, an altercation with his then-girlfriend lead to Pitts' &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/47420-surfer-bloods-john-paul-pitts-arrested-for-battery/" target="_blank"&gt;arrest for domestic battery&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, no charges were filed, but as Pitts &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9129-surfer-blood/" target="_blank"&gt;told Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;, that same tumultuous relationship inspired many of &lt;i&gt;Pythons&lt;/i&gt;' lyrics. Even before you hear one note, you may feel conflicted about it, and rightfully so. Truth be told, &lt;i&gt;Pythons&lt;/i&gt; seem to feel pretty conflicted about itself: hooky, Weezer-ish guitar pop offset by desperate, discomfiting lyrics, fleeting hopes of reconciliation quickly dashed by heavy-hearted resignation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Produced by Gil Norton (&lt;i&gt;Doolittle&lt;/i&gt;, Del Amitri), &lt;i&gt;Pythons&lt;/i&gt; is a sleeker affair than 2010's bedroom-born &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13844-astro-coast/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Astro Coast&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and 2011's knotty &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15962-tarot-classics/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tarot Classics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; EP. With 10 lean songs in 32 minutes, there's hardly a second to waste, so &lt;i&gt;Pythons&lt;/i&gt; largely dispenses with pageantry and heads straight for the stomp box. Instrumentally, Surfer Blood's reared-on-Pavement looseness proves hard to shake even on these no-nonsense melodies; guitars dive-bomb into choruses, hooks turn into group shout-alongs. This more focused approach occasionally causes slight tunnelvision, songs that seem to rise and fall in essentially the same fashion. There are exceptions, of course: "I Was Wrong" dips a toe into grunge, and the waltzy "Needles &amp;amp; Pins" harkens back to the Everly Brothers. But there's a satisfying simplicity in all those clean lines and bright-as-can-be hooks, a gleaming surface to bury the dark stuff under.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pythons&lt;/i&gt;' musical confidence is not shared by its narrator. Pitts spends the record sounding one kind of despondent after another: he points fingers, apologizes profusely, hopes something will change, realizes it won't. He sounds stuck in place, his mind constantly reeling, his next move unclear. Pitts certainly seems sorry for something; "Gravity" sees him making apologies for "never stopping when we oughta," a line that both absorbs and assigns some of the blame for the shambolic romance described throughout. Pitts is quick to paint himself in an unflattering light: codependent, unstable, at fault. "Blair Witch" finds Pitts pleading, "I need love, but the more I see love, the more I need love," an unguarded statement that suggests Pitts is at least aware he's got some stuff to work on. "If I fell apart, would you stay?" he asks at one point, aware of the awfulness of the situation but still willing to keep going with it, consequences be damned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It doesn't always work; "Say Yes to Me" and "Blair Witch" affix themselves to a couple of phrases-- "true blue" and "sour grapes", respectively-- they can't quite rescue from cliche. Whenever the music gets heavier-- the verses of "I Was Wrong", bits of "Slow Six"-- the lyrical self-flagellation and the muddy guitars congeal into a thick, momentum-halting sludge. The songwriting's fairly sturdy overall, but highlights are a little hard to come by; lead single "Weird Shapes." comes close, but there's really nothing here that'll knock the wind out of you quite like &lt;i&gt;Astro Coast&lt;/i&gt;'s "Swim". Pitts proves adept at conjuring the confusion and conflict of the last days of a troubled relationship, and-- probably wisely-- makes himself seem fairly unsympathetic in the process. But he's not always so great at fleshing out the person on the other end of the line, which leaves &lt;i&gt;Pythons&lt;/i&gt; feeling trapped in Pitts' head, a spot where plenty of listeners won't want to spend much time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I heard about John Paul Pitts' arrest last summer, my first response, like that of many others, was a swift and decisive, "Fuck you." Even as more information has come to light, my feelings haven't changed much; Pitts maintains his innocence, and plea-and-pass might be enough for the Florida courts where forgiveness is concerned, but without hearing the other side of the story, I'm still not so sure. &lt;i&gt;Pythons&lt;/i&gt;, seething with autobiography, doesn't make it easy to forget the circumstances around its creation, and separating the art from the artists here takes some serious doing; that score at the top of the page is for &lt;i&gt;Pythons&lt;/i&gt;, not the people who made it. With &lt;i&gt;Pythons&lt;/i&gt; out there, Pitts is going to have to get up there again and again and sing these songs, so full of hurt and confusion, penitence and longing. We'll never know completely what happened that night, but I sincerely hope Pitts never lets himself forget it. As long as he's out there singing "I Was Wrong", he probably never will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Since leaving “Saturday Night Live” in 2012, it might appear that things aren't going as planned for &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27233-the-lonely-island/" target="_blank"&gt;the Lonely Island&lt;/a&gt;, the New York-by-way-of-California comedy troupe consisting of Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer. Samberg’s jump into full-time movie making hasn’t quite stuck, leading to one film he’s hoping that everyone will forget about and one that seemed like a minor hit at first but turned out to be somewhat lifeless. Schaffer’s turn in the director’s chair for a pair of features-- 2007’s criminally underrated &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787475/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hot Rod &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;and 2012’s underwhelming &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1298649/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-- suggest he’s not quite ready for the upper tier in that role. Taccone is better known for his “Girls” character than for his own modern cult classic &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1470023/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;MacGruber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, though he’s certainly making a bundle as director for those ubiquitous “It’s Not Complicated” commercials for AT&amp;amp;T. (Taccone technically left his job at “Saturday Night Live” before Schaffer and Samberg but continued to collaborate on Digital Shorts.) In a certain light, another Lonely Island album might seem like a desperate attempt to reinvigorate a fanbase that might have lost interest in the collective’s breed of joyfully silly farce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Luckily &lt;i&gt;The Wack Album&lt;/i&gt; is just as good as their previous collections, 2009’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12690-incredibad/"&gt;Incredibad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and 2011’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15443-turtleneck-chain/"&gt;Turtleneck &amp;amp; Chain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Knowing that the tracks would likely be divorced from memorable, NBC-funded visual complements this time around (a song like &lt;i&gt;Incredibad&lt;/i&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://www.thelonelyisland.com/video/natalie-rap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;“Natalie's Rap”&lt;/a&gt; surely got the benefit of the doubt by merit of having a deviant Natalie Portman trashing shit in the “SNL” counterpart), it feels like the Lonely Island puts a little more oomph into the songs themselves, a little more intelligence into their parodies of overused rap album staples. (The operatic, hilarious leadoff “Dramatic Intro” and the ridiculous “I’m a Hustler (Song?)” are genre sendups as effective as any they’ve ever done, which includes the sublime &lt;a href="http://www.hulu.com/playlist/81182" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;“Jack Sparrow”&lt;/a&gt;.) Sure, a few jokes fall flat, and a few run out of steam really fast-- the song where Andy raps from the perspective of Michael Bloomberg (“I Run NY”), two separate songs where they swap out “fuck” for “honk” and “hug”, respectively (“Hugs”, “I Don’t Give a Honk”)-- but that’s typical of a Lonely Island or, for that matter, a Weird Al record.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lonely Island’s jokes, for the most part, invent a ridiculous world and push the silliness to extremes, stretching the same idea in different directions (&lt;a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/digital-short-yolo/n32022/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;“YOLO”&lt;/a&gt;) or continuing their mastery of sending up bro culture (“We Are a Crowd”, “The Compliments”). Sometimes the song might hint at a deeper meaning or stance; for instance, in a recent &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9143-the-lonely-island/" target="_blank"&gt;Pitchfork interview&lt;/a&gt;, the group framed &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q9rLdxS7CE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;“Spring Break Anthem”&lt;/a&gt; as their statement about gay marriage. Others, like “You’ve Got the Look” or the posse introduction riff “Meet the Crew”, are just straight up goofy fun. Andy, adopting rappers’ penchant for spelling words out to fit a rhyme pattern, strings together 69 seconds of rapid-fire alphabet for a lewd roundup of how his life is going. Kiv brags about &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V35jvY0u7I" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;“Diaper Money”&lt;/a&gt;, having enough cashflow to keep his kids in fresh diapers, brags that escalate into “wife pussy”, and Andy’s ownership of a choice grave plot. All three playfully spin-off hashtag rap with the Solange feature “Semicolon”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like to think that the group’s output is spiritually influenced by something like Tamra Davis’ &lt;i&gt;Billy Madison&lt;/i&gt;-- basically a sea of Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandlers’ inside jokes that you might not get, but a welcoming storm of inanity that you can’t help but enjoy. But what makes the &lt;i&gt;The Wack Album&lt;/i&gt; work is the wide range of musical styles the group plants themselves in, from dubstep to “golden era” throwback rap, to auto-tuned R&amp;amp;B to Samberg and Timberlake’s still-potent Color Me Badd riff &lt;a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/243571" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;“3-Way (The Golden Rule)”&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;The Wack Album&lt;/i&gt; is full of smart hat-tips that underscore the fun, allusions to Digital Underground that flex the trio’s rap-loving roots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wack Album&lt;/i&gt;’s guests-- a murderer’s row of collaborators featuring the likes of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/" target="_blank"&gt;Robyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/" target="_blank"&gt;Pharrell Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/" target="_blank"&gt;Kendrick Lamar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/" target="_blank"&gt;Solange&lt;/a&gt;, Hugh Jackman, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/" target="_blank"&gt;Lady Gaga&lt;/a&gt;, Adam Levine, and more-- all seem to enjoy being there, an aspect that makes the jokes stronger. Though the group works largely without their former ace-in-the whole, Asa Taccone (Jorma’s younger brother, who ably handled the production of the first two Lonely Island albums but has been focusing on his own music lately) &lt;i&gt;The Wack Album&lt;/i&gt;'s crew of rotating producers deliver a fresh sound palette that punches up the jokes and allows the Lonely Island to do what they do best-- try and make each other laugh. It’s silly, it’s in no shape or form subtle, it’s fun, it works. From “Lazy Sunday” to &lt;i&gt;The Wack Album&lt;/i&gt;'s closing “Perfect Saturday”, you could argue that the group has hardly missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, the then-16 year-old Croydon DJ &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28028-benga/"&gt;Benga&lt;/a&gt; released his first single, “Skank”, an exploratory 2-step track that took equal parts inspiration from the dark garage experimentalist Wookie, grime, and the beginnings of dubstep. The track wasn’t as brilliant as it was an exciting look into a new wave of UK bass for which Benga would later become a mascot. “Night”, his 2007 collaboration with Digital Mystikz’ Coki, is easily one of the greatest dubstep tracks of all time, wherein melodic, funky, and chomping guttural bass play a game of tug-of-war. When the UK’s basement dance scene slowly began creeping outwards, Benga stayed on track; he became part of dubstep super-group &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29277-magnetic-man/"&gt;Magnetic Man&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/14235-skream/"&gt;Skream&lt;/a&gt; and Artwork, scored a BBC Radio 1 show, and in 2011 turned his production know-how into pop sheen for &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29414-katy-b/"&gt;Katy B&lt;/a&gt;’s breakout single, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNhPYj-5rIY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;“Katy on a Mission”&lt;/a&gt;, and her next hit “Perfect Stranger” (producing the latter as Magnetic Man). With the release of his newest, third full-length &lt;i&gt;Chapter II&lt;/i&gt;, one thing is clear; this is not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; Benga.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s nothing harder for a fan of Benga than to hear him produce with relevancy in mind. &lt;i&gt;Chapter II &lt;/i&gt;is full of festival-leaning ideas: razor-edged &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"&gt;Skrillex&lt;/a&gt; bass, ambient trance synths, vocalists singing about love and stuntin' on rivals. And it’s no surprise that the producer comes closest to pop-friendly bangers when he uses female vocalists and builds under them. “Smile” features &lt;a href="http://ec2-54-225-238-235.compute-1.amazonaws.com/admin/albumreviews/albumreview/18146/pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Charli XCX&lt;/a&gt; in “Take My Hand”-fashion; half-melodrama and half-defiant punk as bass wubs beneath her and melodic keys sparkle around her. “Higher” fares similarly; its day-glo trance synths build to a frenetic drum and bass beat that leads the singer through love in the club. The pair were no doubt made with radio-play and EDM fandom in mind, but still translate as lesser-than when put in context with the strength of his previous large-scale hits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And perhaps that’s part of the problem: &lt;i&gt;Chapter II&lt;/i&gt; often appears to be catering to tastes when its creator's greatest successes come when he's doing anything but. Benga is one of the DJs that helped made dubstep a pop reference in the first place; before Bieber and will.i.am, there was &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27831-la-roux/" target="_blank"&gt;La Roux&lt;/a&gt; and Skream, Britney and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28713-rusko/" target="_blank"&gt;Rusko&lt;/a&gt;, Katy B and Benga. (Which also forces the questions: Why isn’t Katy B anywhere to be found on this album? And will he be on her forthcoming one?) Instead of pushing forward, all too often the DJ just toes the line of cliched dance pop; “There’s No Soul” unfortunately lives up to its name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;There are some decent ideas to be found here, though, and Benga’s technical production savvy is still something to be admired. “Click and Tap” is a gem where loops of tightly-rolled snares are joined by pulsing, melodic bass lines, and the track ends up serving as an interlude to “Forefather”, which brings out rapper and grime MC Kano to complement Benga’s gritty dubstep pumelling. “To Hell and Back” is a moshpit-ready explosion of abrasive propulsion with menacing kickdrums and wailing horns on the hook. Its chug of battling beats could have followed the producer’s catchy “Baltimore Clap”. The problem with &lt;i&gt;Chapter II&lt;/i&gt; is that even the album’s high points are only just good, when the dubstep world has reasonably come to expect &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; things from Benga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28590-quadron/" target="_blank"&gt;Quadron&lt;/a&gt; are a musician’s band. The Danish duo count &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/" target="_blank"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/" target="_blank"&gt;Kendrick Lamar&lt;/a&gt;, and Pharrell amongst their many famous fans. It’s not hard to see their appeal: Airtight and carefully virtuosic, they’re perfectly wrapped up in their own hermetically sealed pop world. The attraction largely boils down to singer Coco O’s elastic voice, sometimes chirpy and sometimes soulful. She works in the tradition of the last decade’s neo-soul elite, channeling the jazzy effortlessness of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5185-amy-winehouse/" target="_blank"&gt;Amy Winehouse&lt;/a&gt; circa &lt;i&gt;Frank&lt;/i&gt; and the vulnerability of also-ran Duffy, shapeshifting between extremes mid-song. &lt;i&gt;Avalanche &lt;/i&gt;is the duo’s second album, and the one that’s poised to earn them wider attention off the back of simple and effective songcraft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Coco’s partner is Robin Hannibal, also the mastermind behind buzzed-about R&amp;amp;B act &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30273-rhye/" target="_blank"&gt;Rhye&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Avalanche&lt;/i&gt; is dominated by his touch, an oh-so-perfect production hand that brings to mind the fastidious fuss of &lt;a href="pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/" target="_blank"&gt;Fleetwood Mac&lt;/a&gt; minus the shag carpet thud. This all-consuming perfection is at once Quadron’s most alienating and tantalizing quality-- no alarms and no surprises-- set out in clear tones from the very beginning with “LFT”. Cautious horns, careful guitar, and flamboyant strings offer an impossibly polished surface for Coco’s vocals to glide over, singing a melody that’s just twisty enough not to challenge the listener. “Yes I’m still looking/ Looking for trouble,” she intones defiantly, as if trying to prove her own edginess in a world of perfectly rounded corners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The duo have deservedly received plenty of pre-release attention for &lt;i&gt;Avalanche’&lt;/i&gt;s first single &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15097-hey-love/" target="_blank"&gt;“Hey Love”&lt;/a&gt;. With its throbbing hand percussion and Timbaland-worthy vocal snippets, it has all the precociousness of one of those folky ditties that soundtracked iPod commercials at their ubiquitous peak in the mid 2000s. It’s bolstered with an earworm of a chorus, but it’s a bit of a fake-out: &lt;i&gt;Avalanche&lt;/i&gt; prefers intimate ballads over perky pop, offering nothing else as jaunty as “Hey Love”. That’s not a bad thing in itself, but the songs feel a little insincere when saddled with the band’s generic lyrics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The way Coco borrows mannerisms from country, 60s pop, and other recognizable signifiers brings to mind &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/" target="_blank"&gt;Camera Obscura&lt;/a&gt; stripped of their excess and showmanship. But her lyrics lack that band's depth and detail, meaning her vocal tics have to pick up the slack. On songs like “Crush”, she’s front and centre, exploring every corner of her voice, and moving from raspy and snarky to hurt and forlorn at the flip of a coin. These slower tracks are a catch 22, however, because when she doesn’t have a stellar melody to orient her, like on “Befriend”, it feels like she’s merely stringing together cliches. Other attempts at more upbeat pop (“Neverland”, “It’s Gonna Get You”) are anodyne and patently inoffensive, music made to be quietly piped through coffee shop speakers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;But when they’re on, they’re on. &lt;i&gt;Avalanche&lt;/i&gt; ends with a stretch of soft-rock stunners, including the heartfelt title track and the slide guitar daydream of “Sea Salt”. “Better Off”, with its summer afternoon swing and gentle ebb, is arguably the album’s best song-- here Coco’s vocals sound expert and controlled, topped off with an appearance from a sedate Kendrick Lamar. He’s neutered and hushed to fit into their own cultivated world, because above all, Quadron inhabit a very specific universe on &lt;i&gt;Avalanche&lt;/i&gt;, one where no note or sound is out of place. If schlocky FM-lite pop is what you’re into, there’s lots to like on &lt;i&gt;Avalanche&lt;/i&gt;, but it’s an album that feels hard to love. &lt;i&gt;Avalanche&lt;/i&gt;’s obsessive squeaky cleanness keeps its audience at a distance. Coco might insist that she’s still looking for trouble, but there’s none to be found on &lt;i&gt;Avalanche.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="docs-internal-guid-3575b35e-2064-af88-1749-48b330bc9986" dir="ltr"&gt;Jesse Lortz used to record as &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/9212-the-dutchess-and-the-duke/" target="_blank"&gt;the Dutchess and the Duke&lt;/a&gt;, until he and his collaborator Kimberly Morrison parted ways. Now he records as &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29749-case-studies/" target="_blank"&gt;Case Studies&lt;/a&gt;, a studiously manila folder-blank name. The music he makes is similarly understated, and arguing for its muted virtues can be uphill, unsexy work; if you were a fan of &lt;a href="pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/" target="_blank"&gt;the National&lt;/a&gt; prior to &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5719-alligator/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alligator&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, when they were a bleak, Americana-inflected Brooklyn bar band, then Case Studies may hold some appeal-- specifically, the project recalls 2003's &lt;i&gt;Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lortz is an observant songwriter, however, and both &lt;i&gt;This Is Another Life&lt;/i&gt; and his previous Case Studies effort,&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15764-the-world-is-just-a-shape-to-fill-the-night/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt; The World Is Just a Shape to Fill the Night&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, wear their moroseness handsomely.  &lt;i&gt;This Is Another Life&lt;/i&gt; is a writerly album; the sweetly self-effacing, solo-&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/" target="_blank"&gt;Paul-McCartney&lt;/a&gt;-reminiscent "From Richard Brautigan", a late-album highlight, finds Lortz repurposing Brautigan's bits of wisdom for his lyrics. His plummy, low voice, the most direct and unavoidable connection to the National, draws your attention to the shape of his words and lines and makes some very unattractive sentiments ring with dark beauty: "And if you have any decency, then you'll pretend to be asleep so I can write/ I've never made an enemy that didn't fall in love with me for a while," he moans on "Passage/ Me in the Dark".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The album's sound is similarly mellow and rounded, warmed by lovely upright piano and strings. The arrangements, which Lortz worked out with guitarist and composer Jon Parker, allow for arcing, slide-guitar leads, small embers of Hammond organs, and, on "Driving East, and Through Her", even some Keith Richards-style chop chords slide gracefully to the foreground. "Driving East", "Brautigan", and the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/" target="_blank"&gt;Marissa Nadler&lt;/a&gt; duet "Villain" prick the album's gray tone, and are the best things on it. "Driving East"'s modest Southern-boogie steam gives a wry edge to Lortz's doomed-relationship chronicles. "Those days became some photographs I wish I had not received," he sings, affectionately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the darkness is where Lortz repeatedly returns, and when he does, the album swoons into a near-stasis. Nadler's vocals on "Villain" are so welcome, in part, because they offer some relief; otherwise, spending the album's duration in the windows-shut, blinds-drawn parlor of Lortz's mind is pretty suffocating. The focus on Lortz's vocals and lyrics also has the tendency to foreground florid stretches like this, from "You Say to Me, You Never Have to Ask", where his pen gets away from him, wildly: "I have known witches/ I have felt so serene in my veins/ And your lips are whispering spells and your fingers are magical wands." The record bottoms out with the longeurs of "The Beast With No Name", where he sings "If you were a dove in a cloud of ravens/ Swirling as just one animal/ Would you deliver me safely to your nest in the morning light?" over weeping strings. The moment lays flat, as does the imagery, and it's where Lortz's project finally crosses the line where "tasteful" shades into "inert."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was once a sense of momentum to the music made by Lewis Roberts, the Glasgow-based producer who records under the name &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28921-koreless/"&gt;Koreless&lt;/a&gt;. "Up Down Up Down" from 2009 matched elegant patterns to a skittering beat, delivered via a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrq8WJYwOwY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;YouTube clip&lt;/a&gt; depicting traffic pouring in and out of a city. Now, some four years later, Roberts is all about suspending figures in time, chopping out the forward thrust altogether. The basic elements were already in place-- cut the beats from "Up Down Up Down" and the track wouldn't sound out of place on &lt;i&gt;Yūgen&lt;/i&gt;, a five-track EP for &lt;a href="http://theyoungturks.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Young Turks&lt;/a&gt; that forms the most significant Koreless release to date. But this isn't simply a case of Roberts figuring out where he can go by muting the drum tracks on his sequencer. There's a whole world of thought in &lt;i&gt;Yūgen&lt;/i&gt;, a creeping sense that its weightlessness was only arrived at after long hours of procrastination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Roberts discussed how his music is positioned far from anything that could be described as &lt;br /&gt;"real" in a recent &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9135-koreless/"&gt;Rising&lt;/a&gt; feature, emphasizing his love of artifice and rigidity. There's no looseness here, no feeling of him trying to overmatch the binary code scrolling down his screen. Instead, there's a sense of parity between man and machine, of Roberts respecting the framing devices his artificial working partner puts around his output. There's a feeling not dissimilar to the one &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"&gt;Kraftwerk&lt;/a&gt; found on "Computer Love", where a tender synthesis of human emotions and mechanics are set in motion. At its best, on a track like the stuttering closer "Never", this EP resembles something like dialect between Roberts and his computer, getting close to Isaac Asimov's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robopsychology" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;concept&lt;/a&gt; of a study of the personalities of intelligent machines. It makes even more sense when you learn that Roberts is a committed sci-fi fan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the goal of &lt;i&gt;Yūgen&lt;/i&gt; is to remove the everyday from the equation, it only partly succeeds. But this isn't necessarily a failing of the piece; far from it. In fact, the sense of human emotion that bleeds into each track is what makes it so inviting. It shifts through feelings of loss, hope, and unease, with Roberts often fudging the sound to take it to the brink of malfunction. At times it's reminiscent of a clear-eyed take on the experiments &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30721-daniel-lopatin/"&gt;Daniel Lopatin&lt;/a&gt; has uploaded to YouTube under his &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/sunsetcorp?feature=watch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;SunsetCorp&lt;/a&gt; moniker, especially when he splices the vocal sample on "Ivana" across acres of chimerical synths. It's a very visual record, reflecting the way the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2/"&gt;Haxan Cloak&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17732-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2-excavation/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Excavation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; conjured up images of a painfully laborious stumble through the afterlife. But &lt;i&gt;Yūgen&lt;/i&gt; is more future dystopia than hellish fantasia. "Sun" is all glassy skyscrapers crashing into a purple sea, ripped straight from the cover of a pulpy mid-century science fiction novel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While lost in &lt;i&gt;Yūgen&lt;/i&gt;'s world, it is useful to think back at how the Koreless sound has evolved; the earlier &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QVadIgPglM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;"4D"&lt;/a&gt; had traces of a soulful vocal, something Roberts would surely balk at now. His remix work for &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5720-foals/"&gt;Foals&lt;/a&gt; seems even more incongruous, but presumably the paycheck makes up for it. Still, even in those pieces you can hear him slowly beginning to erase the world from his work. &lt;i&gt;Yūgen&lt;/i&gt; is likely to feel similarly transitory to those early releases. This feels like a beginning, a place that Roberts has worked toward that isn't necessarily going to be where he's going to land. In the Rising feature he talks of more rules, more restrictions, getting to a point where "I don't get any input into it," as he puts it. That thought echoes common considerations about true artificial intelligence, something that feels potentially terrifying and revelatory, but leaves the future tantalizingly wide open.&lt;/p&gt;

The Man: Evil Friends</title><link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18098-portugal-the-man-evil-friends/</link><description>
&lt;p&gt;The latest album by Portland's &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27983-portugal-the-man/" target="_blank"&gt;Portugal. The Man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Evil Friends&lt;/i&gt;, is rarely the same from one minute to the next, careening between alt-rock bombast, punk snot, Lumineersy campfire singalongs, pixelated &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/" target="_blank"&gt;MGMT&lt;/a&gt; headbandcore, dawdling &lt;a href="pitchfork.com/artists/8391-george-harrison/" target="_blank"&gt;George Harrison&lt;/a&gt; solos; you name it, &lt;i&gt;Evil Friends&lt;/i&gt; has probably stuck it somewhere. All that might sound like more than one album can bear, but funnily enough, &lt;i&gt;Evil Friends&lt;/i&gt; is just about the least convoluted Portugal LP so far. With Brian "Danger Mouse" Burton behind the boards, &lt;i&gt;Evil Friends&lt;/i&gt; finds Portugal sharpening their poppier instincts while still leaving room for the proggy ambitions that got them there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least as far back as 2009's &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13270-the-satanic-satanist/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Satanic Satanist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Portugal's hooks sharpened, their restless compositions cut with flyaway choruses. With Burton's help, Portugal continue to clear a path through the fracas; he hasn't done much to tamp down their taste for maximalism, but he's certainly helped them sculpt the melee into something a little less unwieldy, making sure these songs have enough hook to carry the weight of all the instrumental bedlam swirling around them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's not a perfect fit; every surface glistens, and Burton certainly helps Portugal keep a lot of balls in the air while staying mindful of information overload, but his mix has that bright-as-the-sun quality of most modern major label rock that leads to fatigue after too long. And he seems to have talked John Gourley into sticking to the upper ranges of his acrobatic pipes, a move that won't likely sit well with every Portugal fan. Still, Burton helps Portugal keep some control of what could easily turn to chaos, taking great care with their elaborate embellishments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Burton at their backs, Portugal take a surefooted approach on &lt;i&gt;Evil Friends&lt;/i&gt;, confidently blasting through these pan-genre Frankensongs. But, just as the music seems to reposition itself every few seconds, so do John Gourley's lyrics, albeit with a lower success rate. He makes a couple of things clear on &lt;i&gt;Friends&lt;/i&gt;: he's anti-apathy (the presumably ironic "Creep in a T-Shirt"), pro-ecstasy ("Purple Yellow Red and Blue", featuring two-thirds of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/" target="_blank"&gt;Haim&lt;/a&gt;), and more than a little conflicted about religion. "We don't need no modern Jesus to roll with us," he notes. "Who cares if hell awaits," he wonders a bit later, "we're having drinks at heaven's gate."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then there's "Hip Hop Kids". What starts out as a stroll with his young daughter takes a sudden turn into bile-spewing rebuke: "You hip-hop kids think we give a shit when we don't," he spits, apropos of... your guess is as good as mine. Gourley seems like a pleasant enough dude, so this "get off my lawn" thing has to be an act; either way, it doesn't work, the song's tart melody spiked with this untoward bitterness. Several songs on &lt;i&gt;Evil Friends&lt;/i&gt; sport choruses that seem at odds with their verses, or stabs at profundity that don't hold up under scrutiny. With everything else floating around these songs, they could occasionally use an anchor, a task Gourley's flimsier lyrics aren't always up for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It took me maybe four or five good listens before &lt;i&gt;Evil Friends&lt;/i&gt; stopped &lt;span&gt;setting off my claustrophobia&lt;/span&gt;. Even with prolonged exposure, &lt;i&gt;Evil Friends&lt;/i&gt;' ever-present busyness can be overwhelming; there's a lot-- and sometimes too much-- going on here. Still, even when their ambitions outpace their execution, Portugal deserve their props for continuing to overshoot the mark. &lt;span&gt;Seven albums in, with a seemingly permanent mid-day slot at almost every decent-sized festival on either side of the pond and a big-name producer on their side, Portugal. The Man could've easily spent &lt;i&gt;Evil Friends&lt;/i&gt; shedding complexities and doubling down on catchiness. The frequently overstuffed, occasionally scatterbrained album is far from perfect. But even when going for broke gets them into trouble, Portugal seem happy to get up there and overshoot the mark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/" target="_blank"&gt;Deafheaven&lt;/a&gt; weren't always this good. The San Francisco band's early shows found a scrappy, ambitious bunch of punk kids trying to warp black metal with shoegaze in a way that, for all its advances, felt familiar. In late 2010, they signed to &lt;a href="http://www.deathwishinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Deathwish&lt;/a&gt;, the label run by &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/" target="_blank"&gt;Converge&lt;/a&gt;'s Jacob Bannon, and there were expectations in the underground. (Though, at that time, people seemed to focus more on the fact that they didn't &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; like a metal band than what they were creating.) When vocalist George Clarke and songwriter/guitarist Kerry McCoy released their debut LP, &lt;i&gt;Roads to Judah&lt;/i&gt;, in 2011, they added wrinkles to that live sound, especially on the opening track, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12635-violet/" target="_blank"&gt;"Violet"&lt;/a&gt;. The collection didn't always match those standards. It sometimes felt muddled, like they were trying to squeeze too much into the frame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that gorgeous 12-minute set-piece established the template and scope for the band's excellent sophomore album, &lt;i&gt;Sunbather&lt;/i&gt;, a record that finds Deafheaven living up to and then surpassing expectations. Basically, they've learned how to take the sounds they've dreamed up out of their heads so we can hear them, too. If you go back and listen to &lt;i&gt;Roads&lt;/i&gt;, you'll find the elements that appear on &lt;i&gt;Sunbather &lt;/i&gt;with 10 times the intensity. So while the approach here  isn't a surprise, the force with which Deafheaven pulls it off is a revelation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunbather&lt;/i&gt;'s a seven-song collection that fuses into a massive 60-minute piece. The sequencing, moving from brightness to darkness and back, is brilliant. Throughout, McCoy gives in to his inner &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2684-johnny-marr/" target="_blank"&gt;Johnny Marr&lt;/a&gt;, offering deeper, prettier, more eclectic guitar tones. His lines are smeary with tremolo and delay, and the band seamlessly incorporates melancholic piano, harsh Godflesh-style noise bursts, spoken word, lush acoustic strums, and eerie samples. That, and new drummer Daniel Tracy plays big, adding a wallop they've missed in the past. (Deafheaven have always been Clarke and McCoy with a shifting lineup around them; let's hope this one lasts.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is music that inspires the kind of wide-screen feelings people look for in &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/" target="_blank"&gt;Sigur Rós&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/" target="_blank"&gt;Mogwai&lt;/a&gt; (who Deafheaven &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14408-punk-rockcody/" target="_blank"&gt;have covered&lt;/a&gt;), or &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/" target="_blank"&gt;Godspeed You! Black Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Words of anger and frustration collide with the sheer beauty of the music. The power of that blend-- raw black metal and hardcore basking in pastel-colored post-rock guitars-- is something you don't experience in those other groups. There are plaintive moments here, but this is largely music about romantic lust, anger, and disappointment delivered by a band who know their punk and hardcore as well as their metal. They know their &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/" target="_blank"&gt;Cure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/" target="_blank"&gt;the Smiths&lt;/a&gt;, too. Remember the ecstatic closing moments of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5684-fuck-buttons/" target="_blank"&gt;Fuck Buttons&lt;/a&gt;' "Sweet Love for Planet Earth"? Loop that and ask &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/" target="_blank"&gt;Explosions in the Sky&lt;/a&gt; to play the accompanying music and you're tapping into this sound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Deafheaven push this epic music as far as it can go, they retain a central emotional core, and are always in control compositionally. The opening song, "&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15379-deafheaven-dreamhouse/" target="_blank"&gt;Dream House&lt;/a&gt;", is over nine minutes long; the closer, "The Pecan Tree", which moves from dire black metal to triumphant post-rock without any stitches showing, is closer to 12. The four longer songs don't repeat themselves; each is stunning in its constant motion and variation. "Sunbather" is bleaker than "Dream House", for instance, and on "Vertigo", they downshift from gossamer prettiness to full-on heavy with a warped &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/" target="_blank"&gt;My Bloody Valentine&lt;/a&gt; transition followed by their most power metal guitar soloing to date. At the five-minute mark of that song, blast beats enter and it goes black metal. Two minutes later, though, it's soaring again with hook-laden guitars and floor-punching dynamics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even the interstitial parts inspire. "Dream House"'s delicate closing arpeggios blend with "Irresistible",  a three-minute swatch of melancholic guitar and piano that works as a gentle pause before the massive "Sunbather", but is in of itself a gorgeous composition. The grinding industrial noise at the end of "Sunbather" dissolves into "Please Remember", a relatively brief piece that features Alcest's Neige speaking lines from Milan Kundera's novel &lt;i&gt;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&lt;/i&gt;. (Clarke explained its inclusion in a recent &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/9140-deafheaven/" target="_blank"&gt;Show No Mercy&lt;/a&gt;: "That passage is really important to me. It just screams insecurity, which I have huge faults with.") &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clarke's voice mixed with the mountains of cascading guitars and drum crescendos is so strong that you don't need to know what he's saying to feel the effect of the music. But if you &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; decide to read the lyrics, you won't be disappointed: &lt;i&gt;Sunbather&lt;/i&gt; was in part inspired by the singer growing up with his mother and brother without any money and wondering what it'd be like to have it. There's also his realization that, like his largely absent father, he's able to be cold emotionally, and not necessary able to love. The album's central image is of a girl sunbathing outside of her upscale house. Clarke spotted her after moving back home for a bit and while stuck in an existential crisis. He wondered what he'd end up doing himself and, more so, what it would be like to have that girl's existence. And, of course, what it would be like to have that girl. "Dream House" ends with a dialogue Clarke says he pieced together from drunken texts between him and a woman he was crazy about: "'I'm dying.'/ 'Is it blissful?'/ 'It's like a dream.'/ 'I want to dream.'"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Sunbather&lt;/i&gt;, Deafheaven have made one of the biggest albums of the year, one that impresses you with its scale, the way &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/" target="_blank"&gt;Swans&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Seer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; did last year. Like M. Gira's masterpiece, it has the ability to capture the attention of people who don't normally listen to heavy music. It's also one of the most successful examples of a band using black metal as a starting point and ending up somewhere else entirely. People cite the short-lived San Francisco band Weakling's seminal 2000 album &lt;i&gt;Dead as Dreams&lt;/i&gt; as the pinnacle of American black metal; &lt;i&gt;Sunbather&lt;/i&gt; is another. Like Weakling, Deafheaven have changed things with this record-- black metal won't be the same now that it's been released. Of course, folks will argue over just how black metal-- or even metal-- &lt;i&gt;Sunbather&lt;/i&gt; is, and will discuss the "un-metal" pink cover art and the fact that Clarke could probably be a J. Crew model. These kinds of arguments are irrelevant. Instead, try focusing on how much better &lt;i&gt;Sunbather&lt;/i&gt; is than any other black metal album released this year, and how it's, by far, one of the best in any genre. Or, maybe, just talk to your friends about what it feels like to listen to a modern classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/" target="_blank"&gt;Black Sabbath&lt;/a&gt; reunion has been star-crossed almost from the start. Original members Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward staged a splashy press conference in November 2011 to announce a tour and a Rick Rubin-produced album, but the mood quickly soured. Subsequent months brought a lymphoma diagnosis for guitarist and sole consistent member Iommi, a contract dispute involving drummer Ward, high-profile gigs with a fill-in behind the kit, and, finally, the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/49154-black-sabbath-announce-first-studio-lp-with-ozzy-osbourne-since-1978/" target="_blank"&gt;eyebrow-raising news&lt;/a&gt; that the comeback LP-- the first full studio record to involve more than two members of Sabbath 1.0 since 1983's Ozzy-less &lt;i&gt;Born Again&lt;/i&gt;-- would feature &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3515-rage-against-the-machine/" target="_blank"&gt;Rage Against the Machine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/165-audioslave/" target="_blank"&gt;Audioslave&lt;/a&gt; drummer Brad Wilk. The peanut gallery snarked; fans despaired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt; isn't an out-of-touch embarrassment is a surprise. That it's cohesive, engaging, and even fun is a near-shock. As with most Rubin ventures, the goal from the outset was to help the band recapture their original mojo, the chemistry that made their initial 1970-78 run so brilliant. Does &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt; measure up to classics such as &lt;i&gt;Paranoid&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vol. 4&lt;/i&gt;? Of course not. No amount of good intention could recapture the black magic of the band's narcotically enhanced glory days, and while Wilk's performance is sturdy enough, no sub could eclipse Ward, one of the most distinctive rock drummers of the last 40 years and the engine behind Sabbath's signature sludge-blues cadences. But &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt; does offer many of the primal joys that helped immortalize Sabbath in the first place, while documenting the spark that still unites Osbourne, Iommi, and Butler, all three of whom sound about as vital here as anyone could've hoped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The record's greatest strength is how well it captures the apocalyptic trudge that Sabbath nailed from the very first downbeat of their 1970 debut. The doomy passages in the first two tracks, "End of the Beginning" and "God Is Dead?", sound stupendously heavy. This isn't just a result of &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt;'s raw production values; it's also that the band is clearly grasping for the same dire emotions (soul-deep malaise, reaper-fearing horror) that fueled their early work, emotions that from the mid-'80s on-- as Iommi carried on under the Sabbath banner with a Wiki-nightmare's worth of collaborators-- have shared album space with less weighty, more pedestrian hard rock. As Iommi, Butler, and Wilk lurch through the titanic riff of "End of the Beginning", with Ozzy sneering, "&lt;i&gt;Reeeeeee&lt;/i&gt;-animation of the sequence," it's clear that a legacy is being reclaimed. Osbourne, for one, may have squandered any remaining mystique when he opted for reality-TV stardom, but he proves here that he still wields an eerie power at the mic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The album doesn't fixate on crawling gloom. Early Sabbath is often portrayed as monolithic, but the band's 1970-78 discography was as eclectic in its way as the canons of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/" target="_blank"&gt;the Beatles&lt;/a&gt; or Zeppelin. On &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt;, the band salutes fans with obvious allusions to some of their early outside-the-box classics: sassy midtempo groover "Loner" and the faintly cheesy yet improbably moving ballad "Zeitgeist" recall "N.I.B." and "Planet Caravan", respectively. And the sliding-panel, multi-movement structures of "Age of Reason" and "End of the Beginning" serve as a reminder that the original Sabbath explored their own outlandish brand of progressive rock on later LPs such as 1975's &lt;i&gt;Sabotage&lt;/i&gt;. Aside from "God Is Dead?", with its plodding, laborious verses, the album's many long tracks feel brisk and hooky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As sturdy as &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt;'s songs are, the album's signature feature might be its pervasive jamminess. Sabbath were never much for the drawn-out grandstanding of Zeppelin, but they did begin life as a blues band on the nightly grind. The group flaunts those roots constantly on &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt;, in the process spotlighting the partnership that's always been Sabbath's heart and soul: the Iommi/Butler tandem. During triumphant instrumental breakdowns in "End of the Beginning" and "God Is Dead?", the guitarist and bassist braid together like a heavy-metal Garcia and Lesh, forming a single mercurial mass. Iommi indulges in his share of well-deserved guitar-heroism throughout the record-- most notably on the exuberantly bluesy "Damaged Soul"-- but with Butler shadowing him, these so-called solos feel more like hive-mind communions. It doesn't hurt that the bass tone on &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt; is extraordinary-- one of the fattest and most gut-churning that Butler has achieved on record.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Offsetting that blood-brother harmony is the odd man out behind the kit. The stiff unaccompanied drum intro to "Age of Reason" is just one of many reminders here that Wilk comes from an entirely different school, not to mention generation, than his collaborators. While Rage Against the Machine owed Iommi a significant debt in the riff department, that band's rhythmic orientation had far more to do with crisp funk than blues-based hard rock. (To find a truly sympathetic sub for &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt;, Rubin and the band might have looked to the contemporary doom-metal demimonde, home of drummers like Eyehategod's Joey LaCaze, who specialize in the grimy ooze that powered early Sabbath.) Often, as on the triplet-feel verse section of "Live Forever", Wilk sounds like he's trying hard not to mess up. And he doesn't, exactly, but something is lost in the effort. Bill Ward's genius was that he never seemed to care about meeting an objective standard of precision. The early Sabbath drum tracks are riddled with what could technically be described as flubs; they also feature some of the most exhilaratingly earthy percussion rock'n'roll has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be fair, Wilk's appearance was always framed as a sideman gig. (The press materials for &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt; diplomatically state that the band were "joined at the sessions" by the drummer.) And there are moments, such as on the sinister strut that opens "Dear Father", where Wilk achieves a real chemistry with his elders. Details aside, though, Ward's absence from &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt; shouldn't be glossed over. His shaggy, intuitive swing may have been less commanding than the brontosaurus whomp of John Bonham, but it was no less integral to his band's signature sound. Sabbath has at times weathered their countless personnel shifts gracefully; for example, the lineup featuring late vocal great Ronnie James Dio, eventually billed under the name Heaven &amp;amp; Hell, attained its own special brand of dark majesty. Yet the fact that a full-on original-members reunion was promised and then retracted lends &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt; a whiff of the consolation prize. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, &lt;i&gt;13&lt;/i&gt; isn't what every Sabbath die-hard dreamed it might be: a true pick-up-where-they-left-off comeback for the group's founding quartet. But the record does belong in the view of every metalhead-- not just because such a seminal band still deserves obligatory props, but because, imperfections aside, the record embodies the kernel of the original Sabbath idea. That chilling crawl, that low-slung death-blues groove that seemed to come out of nowhere back in 1970, persists here in all its ominous potency, sounding out like an admonition of a genre that's grown increasingly overcalculated and gridlike during the ensuing 40 years, trading tortured humanity for robotic precision. Though fans may resent Black Sabbath for not resolving their personal differences more gracefully, one can't deny the pull of that existential outcry as channeled into what we now know as heavy metal. Their frames might be rusted, but these iron men still walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sounds like Boards of Canada&lt;/i&gt;. In the early years of this century, you heard many electronic music aficionados using that phrase, usually in the context of an endorsement. The Scottish brothers Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin didn’t invent a new sound, but they did take various strands of music floating around and pull them into one place and essentially perfect them. And their particular fusion was so distinctive that their name became shorthand. The appetite for the BoC was so voracious that the group’s actual output, which was actually fairly prolific in its first decade, wasn’t nearly enough to satisfy it. But that was a long time ago. Since 2006 we’ve heard a lot of music that seems spiritually connected to Boards of Canada, from &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"&gt;Burial&lt;/a&gt; to chillwave, but we haven’t heard a note of music from the originators until the surprise &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/50463-boards-of-canada-new-album-tomorrows-harvest/"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Tomorrow’s Harvest&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;While BoC have always seemed comfortable inside their core sound, their records are still easy to distinguish. On &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/838-music-has-the-right-to-children/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Music Has the Right to Children&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they mixed creepy pre-erased drones with childhood nostalgia and drums that drew from hip-hop; on 2002’s &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/837-geogaddi/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Geogaddi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the beats got harder and the unease grew more intense, resulting in an album that was still playful but far darker. &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/839-the-campfire-headphase/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Campfire Headphase&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from 2005, brought acoustic guitars to the table and aimed for a more pastoral feel, but it lacked the tension of what came before. And &lt;i&gt;Tomorrow’s Harves&lt;/i&gt;t is in some ways the flipside to &lt;i&gt;Campfire&lt;/i&gt;, the bucolic tint swapped out for moody drones and encroaching dread. It is the most internally focused of Boards of Canada’s records. Rather than working around the edges of their sound in search of new territory, &lt;i&gt;Tomorrow’s Harvest&lt;/i&gt; finds them drawing back toward the center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Given its hermetic feel, it makes sense BoC have &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/jun/06/boards-of-canada-become-more-nihilistic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; that soundtracks were an especially big influence. They specifically invoke the work of John Carpenter, Mark Isham, and Wendy Carlos, all of whom constructed some of their most enduring scores in the late 1970s and early 80s. That was a period where analog synthesis was reaching full maturity but digital synthesis was in its earlier stages, when the tape-driven Mellotron competed for studio space with the digital Fairlight and new timbres were being explored. If the earliest Boards of Canada music still seemed inspired by Warp’s post-techno &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11714-artificial-intelligence-artificial-intelligence-ii/"&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; movement, beats on &lt;i&gt;Tomorrow's Harvest&lt;/i&gt; are secondary. The tempos are generally slow, and there’s not much trickiness to the percussion. The tracks tend to create a groove and stick with it for the duration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The creative energy here is directed toward building textures, which are very deep and rich indeed. The most visceral sound design in Boards of Canada’s music has tended to occur during their short interludes, but here they’ve taken some those ideas and explored them at length, filling the tracks with details that can take some time to soak in. On headphones, you can explore the tracks one motif at a time, as if each were a small landscape. “Jacquard Causeway” has a series of metallic-sounding twinkles that seems to grow out of the chords that swell underneath, and they slip in and out of phase with the underlying drums in a manner that imparts an extra measure of uneasiness. “Split Your Infinities” has bird sounds and distant noises that sound like lasers, both of which are so subtle so as to function subliminally. “Nothing Is Real” is a swirl of deep bass, stop-start drums, and a continual surging synth line that sounds like a swarm of bugs, but it also has a distant, echoing keyboard line that haunts the track like a ghost. The layering of the various sounds on a given track offers a different way in each time, so they can take on an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;M.C. Escher&lt;/a&gt;-like quality, where the tone and emotional content varies according to what you choose to pay attention to. There are sounds behind sounds and sounds underneath sounds and you can find yourself sifting through the layers, turning the pieces inside-out. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;If Boards of Canada’s sound construction has reached a new plateau, they do seem to have left some appealing elements of their earlier approach behind. Returning again to &lt;i&gt;Music&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Geogaddi&lt;/i&gt;, it’s striking how tuneful those records were. Whether they’ve lost that ability or no longer choose to incorporate it, melody is not the focus on &lt;i&gt;Tomorrow’s Harvest&lt;/i&gt;. These tracks unfurl, grow, and shrink, but they don’t exactly develop, at least not in the same way. The early playfulness, too, is no longer part of the equation. It’s easy to forget about “childlike” for Boards of Canada at one point didn’t just mean the ache of nostalgia or the fear of nightmares but actually pleasurable activities like clapping hands and laughing and saying funny words. And the lightness and humor-- the repetition of the word “Orange” in "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg-iKP0zI9Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Aquarius&lt;/a&gt;", say-- are something they don’t seem remotely interested in here. It’s not hard to imagine a certain kind of Boards of Canada fan missing that variety. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;So that’s what is not here. What we’re left with is Boards of Canada’s moodiest record, a full-length tinted with atmosphere that unfolds slowly and is happy to allow you to come to it. Creating a new way to hear electronic music, as they did in the first half of their career, earned them that right to make a record that is absorbed through osmosis. And true to its patient nature and long gestation period, &lt;i&gt;Tomorrow’s Harvest&lt;/i&gt;’s last third is its best. As they move from the ultra-simple, &lt;i&gt;Music for Films&lt;/i&gt;-like “Sundown” through the soot-dusted “New Seeds”, with its quiet guitar grind and bell-like percussion, and then on through the arpeggiated Tangerine Dream-style “Come to Dust” and the the closing bass-pedals of “Semena Mertvykh”, it’s clear that they still, after all this time and all the imitators, own this world. And it’s nice to hear that they’re still inhabiting it.&lt;/p&gt;
